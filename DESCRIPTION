Description: Efficient algorithm for solving PU(positive and unlabelled) problem in low or high dimensional setting with lasso or group lasso penalty. The algorithm uses Maximization-Minorization and (block) coordinate descent. Sparse calculation and parallel computing via OpenMP are supported for the computational speed-up.
