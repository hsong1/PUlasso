# PUlasso

Efficient algorithm for solving PU (Positive and Unlabeled) problem in low or high dimensional setting with lasso or group lasso penalty. The algorithm uses Maximization-Minorization and (block) coordinate descent. Sparse calculation and parallel computing are supported for the computational speed-up.
