#' simulated PU data
#'
#' A simulated data for the illustration. 
#' we draw covariates \eqn{x_i} from \eqn{N(\mu,I_{5x5})} or \eqn{N(-\mu,I_{5x5})} with probability 0.5.
#' To make the first two variables active, we let \eqn{\mu = [\mu_1,\dots,\mu_2,0,0,0]^T, \theta = [\theta_0,\dots,\theta_2,0,0,0]^T} and set \eqn{\mu_i=1.5, \theta_i ~ Unif[0.5,1]}
#' Responses \eqn{y_i} is simulated via \eqn{P_\theta(y=1|x) = 1/exp(-\theta^Tx)}.
#' 1000 observations are sampled from the subpopulation of positives(y=1) and labelled, and another 1000 observations are sampled from the original population and unlabelled.
#'
#' @format A list containing model matrix X, true response y, labelled/unlabelled response vector z, and a true positive probability truePY1.
